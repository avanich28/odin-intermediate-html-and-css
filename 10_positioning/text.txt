Positioning

Default 
position: static

The difference between static and relative is fairly simple. 
Static is the default position of every element, and properties top, right, bottom, and left do not affect the position of the element

// not computed position value

position: relative

Properties top, ri....(etc.) displace the element relative to its normal position in the flow of the document.

// If you donâ€™t set a z-index value, this element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned element. (just only static!) ðŸ”¥
// Limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements ðŸ”¥

position: absolute

Elements that are removed from the normal flow of the document donâ€™t affect other elements and are also not affected by other elements.
while being positioned relative to an ancestor element

// height and width set to auto
// These values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning.

position: fixed

Fixed elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document and are positioned relative to the viewport.

// fixed to viewport

position: sticky

Sticky elements will act like a static until you scroll past them, then they start behaving like fixed elements.
